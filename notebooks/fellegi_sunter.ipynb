    "similarity is returned on a discrete scale (not a value from a continuous\n",
    "interval). So stick to integers or letters of the alphabet, project and\n",
    "approximate the similarity and you'll be fine. \n",
    "* other models might return different results during the comparisons. So we need\n",
    "room for expansion: an F-S comparison is not the same as a naive Bayes\n",
    "comparison (that one only allows `-1` and `1` as the result of a value\n",
    "comparison). So these comparisons work with very different result types. F-S is\n",
    "technically limited to a finite subset of integers, whereas Naive Bayes allows\n",
